                <h3 id="main2">Ferruccio Lamborghini</h3>
                <p>
                    Ferruccio Lamborghini was an Italian entrepreneur and the founder of the renowned luxury sports car manufacturer, Lamborghini. Born on April 28, 1916, in Cento, Italy, Lamborghini initially pursued a career in mechanics and engineering, establishing a successful tractor manufacturing business, Lamborghini Trattori, after World War II.

                <h3 id="main3">Before the business</h3>
                <p>
                    After the war, Lamborghini founded Lamborghini Trattori in 1948, specializing in manufacturing high-quality tractors using surplus military hardware. His commitment to innovation and quality quickly propelled his tractors to prominence in the agricultural industry, establishing him as a successful businessman.

                    Beyond tractors, Lamborghini diversified his business ventures into other fields, including heating and air conditioning systems, with companies like Lamborghini Bruciatori and Lamborghini Calor. Despite his success in these sectors, Lamborghini harbored a deep passion for luxury cars. He owned several high-performance vehicles, including Ferraris, Maseratis, and Alfa Romeos.

                    Later, Lamborghini turned his attention to his passion for high-performance cars and established Automobili Lamborghini in 1963. Dissatisfied with the service he received from Ferrari, Lamborghini aimed to create superior grand touring cars that rivaled Ferrari’s offerings in terms of performance and luxury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After selling Lamborghini in the 1970s, Ferruccio Lamborghini retired to pursue other interests, including winemaking and property development. He passed away on February 20, 1993, leaving behind a lasting legacy as an automotive visionary and entrepreneur whose name remains synonymous with luxury and innovation in the world of high-performance automobiles.
