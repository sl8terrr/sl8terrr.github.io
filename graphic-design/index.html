        <p><b> Graphic design</b> is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup> academic 
            discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and applied art whose activity 
            consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit 
            specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of 
            design<sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. Its practice involves 
            creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital 
            tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate 
            visually.</p>

        <p> The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is 
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the 
            compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery 
            to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone 
            expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a 
            demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally 
            or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic 
            message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup> 
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of 
            rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of 
            consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged
             as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with 
             advertising in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its evolution 
             allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and 
             massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for 
             experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of
              the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention 
              to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
              develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

        <h2 id="terminology"> Terminology </h2>
        <hr>
            <p> William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the 
                term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> although
                 it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
                 Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San 
                 Francisco, in an article about technical education for 
                 printers:<sup>[15]</sup>
                <br>
                <br>
                An Enterprising Trades Union<br>
                … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
                among printers is an assurance that with the elemental 
                principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow
                 in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and
                  decorating. …
                <br>
                <br>
                A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California 
                School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic 
                Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design 
                and Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.

            <h4>Historical Background</h4>
                <p>In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were 
                    cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist 
                    texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest 
                    known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, 
                    longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type 
                    printing, making books widely available during the Song 
                    dynasty (960–1279).<sup>[19]</sup>
                    <br><br>
                    In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes 
                    Gutenberg developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a 
                    faster pace using movable type made with a new metal alloy
                    <sup>[20]</sup> that created a revolution in the 
                    dissemination of information.<sup>[21]</sup></p>
            <h4> Nineteenth century</h4>
                <p> In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design
                     education in Great Britain, informing the government of the
                      importance of design in his Journal of Design and 
                      Manufactures. He organized the Great Exhibition as a 
                      celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian 
                      design.
                      
                    <br><br>
                    From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a 
                    leader in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts
                     movement, creating hand-made books in medieval and 
                     Renaissance era style,<sup>[22]</sup> in addition to 
                     wallpaper and textile designs.<sup>[23]</sup> Morris' work,
                      along with the rest of the Private Press movement, 
                      directly influenced Art Nouveau.<sup>[24]</sup>

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
                technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in 
                branding products and elements of company identity such as 
                logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.
                <br><br>
                From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
                opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful
                 compositions of visual information – known as information 
                 design. With the advent of the web, information designers with 
                 experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to 
                 illustrate the background to news stories. </p>

        <p>A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of 
            existing text, ornament, and images.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights 
            the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages.
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs 
            which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.</p>
