        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 lbs red potatos
                <li> 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
                    <li> 2 tbsp Ranch dry seasoning mix
                        <li> Salt and pepper
                        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3> Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
                <li>In a large bowl add potatoes and toss with olive oil. 
                    Then, add in the Ranch dressing mix and salt and pepper 
                    to taste. Toss well to coat each potato piece evenly.
                <li> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour potatoes 
                    onto the baking sheet and spread out potatoes evenly in a 
                    single layer.
                <li>Bake potatoes in oven until potatoes are cooked through, and
                     edges start to turn very dark brown, approximately 20-25 
                     minutes. To check to see if they are done, pierce one of 
                     the larger pieces of potato with a fork to see if it is 
                     soft.
                    <li>Serve immediately.
                    </ol>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 6 streaky bacon rashers or 3 back bacon rasher
                        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3> Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
                <li>Lay the bacon in a single layer in the base of an air fryer 
                    – be sure the layers aren't overlapping. The size of the air
                     fryer basket will determine how many rashers you can cook 
                     at one time.
                <li> Set the air fryer to 200C and cook streaky bacon rashers 
                    for 6-10 mins – just-cooked bacon will take 6 mins, but 
                    crispier bacon will take 9-10 mins. Cook back bacon rashers 
                    for 4-8 mins, depending on your preference. If you are 
                    cooking in batches, remember that the second batch will 
                    usually be quicker as the air fryer has heated up.
                <li>Remove the bacon using tongs and put on kitchen paper to 
                    drain before serving.
                    </ol>
