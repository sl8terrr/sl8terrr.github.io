                <h3>Ferruccio Lamborghini</h3>
                <p>
                    Ferruccio Lamborghini was an Italian entrepreneur and the founder of the renowned luxury sports car manufacturer, Lamborghini. Born on April 28, 1916, in Cento, Italy, Lamborghini initially pursued a career in mechanics and engineering, establishing a successful tractor manufacturing business, Lamborghini Trattori, after World War II.

                <p>
                    As a young man, Lamborghini was drawn more to farming machinery rather than the farming lifestyle itself. Following his interest in mechanics, Lamborghini studied at the Fratelli Taddia technical institute near Bologna. In 1940 he was drafted into the Italian Royal Air Force, where he served as a mechanic at the Italian garrison on the island of Rhodes, territory of the Kingdom of Italy since 1911, after the Italo-Turkish War, becoming the supervisor of the vehicle maintenance unit. When the Germans turned on their former Italian allies in September 1943, most soldiers either fled or were among the 30,000 Italians captured as prisoners of war. Lamborghini initially escaped capture but later returned to his former workplace in civilian clothes working several odd jobs and with the permission of the German forces opened a small vehicle workshop. When the island fell to the British at the end of the war in 1945 he was arrested as a collaborator, and was not able to return home to Italy until the following year. He married, but his wife died in 1947 while giving birth to his first child, a boy named Tonino.

                <h3>Before the business</h3>
                <p>
                    After the war, Lamborghini founded Lamborghini Trattori in 1948, specializing in manufacturing high-quality tractors using surplus military hardware. His commitment to innovation and quality quickly propelled his tractors to prominence in the agricultural industry, establishing him as a successful businessman.

                <p>
                    Beyond tractors, Lamborghini diversified his business ventures into other fields, including heating and air conditioning systems, with companies like Lamborghini Bruciatori and Lamborghini Calor. Despite his success in these sectors, Lamborghini harbored a deep passion for luxury cars. He owned several high-performance vehicles, including Ferraris, Maseratis, and Alfa Romeos.
                </p>
                <h3>Creation of the company</h3>
                <p>
                    Later, Lamborghini turned his attention to his passion for high-performance cars and established Automobili Lamborghini in 1963. Dissatisfied with the service he received from Ferrari, Lamborghini aimed to create superior grand touring cars that rivaled Ferrari’s offerings in terms of performance and luxury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After selling Lamborghini in the 1970s, Ferruccio Lamborghini retired to pursue other interests, including winemaking and property development. He passed away on February 20, 1993, leaving behind a lasting legacy as an automotive visionary and entrepreneur whose name remains synonymous with luxury and innovation in the world of high-performance automobiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1958, Lamborghini traveled to Maranello to buy a Ferrari 250 GT: a two-seat coupé with a body designed by coachbuilder Pininfarina. He went on to own several more over the years, including a Scaglietti-designed 250 GT SWB Berlinetta and a 250 GT 2+2 four-seater. Lamborghini thought Ferrari's cars were good, but too noisy and rough to be proper road cars. He categorized them as repurposed track cars with poorly built interiors.

                <h3>Current lineup</h3>
                <p>
                    The current Lamborghini lineup consists of the revolutionary Revuelto, which is the first HPEV (High Performance Electrified Vehicle) created by Lamborghini.

Additionally, the Lamborghini Urus stands as the world’s first Super Sport Utility Vehicle, combining luxury, sportiness, and performance with everyday comfort and versatility. The lineup also includes Limited Series models for exclusive clients and visionary Concept models that push the boundaries of technology and design.

                    The Lamborghini Revuelto is a mid-engine plug-in hybrid sports car introduced as the successor to the Aventador. The car is named after a Spanish fighting bull and is the first Lamborghini to feature a true hybrid drivetrain. It boasts new design elements such as Y-shaped LED lights, an active aero spoiler, and an exposed engine bay. The interior has been enhanced for increased comfort, and a new hybrid driving mode called “Città” provides reduced power for urban driving. The car’s construction includes a carbon fiber monocoque, making it lighter and more rigid than its predecessor.
